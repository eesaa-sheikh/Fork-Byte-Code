# Fork-Byte-Code Front-end Restaurant Food Review Site

This website is dedicated to foodies wanting restaurant recommendations as well as posting reviews for them.

## Project Outline 

We utilised a restaurant review API for our backend to create a react app. We also imported MUI to create a modal review feature, as well as using the bootstap framework for our carousel.

## MVP 

Before starting our project, we defined our MVP as follows:

- Have a home page with a navbar and footer.
- Have search functionality to allow users to find a specific restaurant or cuisine.
- Display restaurants as a list when searching.
- Be able to view all restaurants from the API.
- Be able to view all reviews from the API.
- Basic CSS styling.


## Extensions 

We were able to implement the following extensions once our MVP was achieved:
- Used MUI to create modals to show and add reviews.
- Used Bootstrap to implement a carousel as part of our hero section of the homepage.
- Convert restaurant from a list to its own cards using CSS.
- Be able to add reviews to a restaurant.
- Imported a custom font for our review 'receipt'
- Implemented media queries to adjust various elements accordingly.
